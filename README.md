## The impact of data science and analytics

Data science and analytics are rapidly shaping every aspect of our lives and our businesses. We’re collecting more data than ever before, but not everyone is able to efficiently analyze all that data to extract meaningful insights. There is incredible power in data—but only if you know what to do with it. DataCamp teaches companies and individuals the skills they need to work with data in the real world
